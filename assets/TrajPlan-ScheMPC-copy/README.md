## Quick Start
### Gurobi
The scheduler is formulated as a MILP and solved using [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/). We recommend using the [academic named-user license](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/13207658935185-How-do-I-retrieve-an-Academic-Named-User-license) for convenience. 


### OpEn
The NMPC formulation is solved using open source implementation of PANOC, namely [OpEn](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation) before proceeding. 

### Install dependencies
It is recommended to use UV for managing Python environments. Create a new environment and install the dependencies using
```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or using pip directly
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate MPC solver
Go to "build_solver.py", change the configuration files to what you want and run
```
python src/build_solver.py
```
After this, a new directory *mpc_solver* will appear and contain the solver. Then, you are good to go :)

## Use Case
Run *main.py* for the simulation with both the scheduler and the MPC controller (after generating the solver):
```
python src/main.py
```
In the script, there are several parameters that can be changed:
- `problem`: <src> the name of the test case to be used. The test cases are stored in "data/test_cases".
- `scheduler`: <bool> whether to run the scheduler or not.
- `controller`: <bool> whether to run the MPC controller or not.
- `naive_tracker`: <bool> whether to use a naive tracker instead of the MPC controller.
- `ignore_speed_ref`: <bool> whether to ignore the speed reference from the global path when using the MPC controller.
- `recording`: <bool> whether to record the simulation.

By default, the script runs both the scheduler and the MPC controller on the "4Small" test case. For the same test case, the schedule needs to be generated only once and must be before running the controller. Only if `controller` is true, the simulation will be run.

## Components
The whole system is mainly composed of five components:
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler ("pkg_schedule") is responsible for generating global paths for each robot. 
- **Map**: The map ("basic_map") is responsible for *(a)* reading and processing map data into geometric map objects or occupancy grid maps; *(b)* reading and generating Networkx graphs storing map nodes and edges. 
- **Obstacle**: The obstacle ("basic_obstacle") is responsible for modeling and processing obstacles.
- **MPC**: The MPC ("pkg_mpc_tracker") is responsible for solving the NMPC problem and generating control inputs for each robot.
- **pkg_path_plan**: The path planner ("pkg_path_plan") is responsible for generating local paths for each robot. It also contains a global path planner to substitute the scheduler in case the scheduler is not available.

## Scheduler or Path Planner
The global guidance for mobile robots has two alternatives from either the scheduler or the global path planner.
1. The scheduler takes a schedule file (CSV) as input and generates global paths for each robot. The schedule file contains at least three columns: `robot_id`, `node_id`, and `time`.
2. The global path planner takes a start node and a goal node as input and generates a global path for the robot.
